A carbon footprint is a measure of the total greenhouse gas emissions associated with all the activities of a person, organization, or product. It includes direct emissions from fossil fuel combustion, transportation, and the production of goods, as well as indirect emissions from the energy used to produce those goods. Carbon footprints are typically expressed in tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year and are crucial for understanding the environmental impact of individual actions and organizations on climate change.
